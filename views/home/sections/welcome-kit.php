                Soon after signing up, you will receive your welcome kit. Look for a small box with our big logo, open it up, and enjoy.

                You will receive two service bags: <br>

                NAVY BLUE (since we mean business) for Wash and Fold Laundry <br>

                TURQUOISE (because we’re fancy) for Dry Cleaning
                <br><br>
                You will also receive a separate mailing with your personal barcode 1-2 business days after the kit. Place the barcodes in the clear pocket of the bags, and you are good to go!
